# Bloc 03 - Machine Learning 

**Certificate - Machine Learning Engineer**

## Overview

This repository is part of the professional certification Machine Learning Engineer (Concepteur Développeur en Science des données) and represents Bloc 3 of the certification titled: "Machine Learning". This bloc contains three projects, each focusing on a different aspect of machine learning, including both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Projects Included

### 1. Project 03 - 1: Walmart Sales

#### Supervised machine learning

Walmart's marketing service has asked to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in their stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help them understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

**Project Structure**

- `walmart-sales`: This directory contains the main Jupyter notebook (`walmart_sales.ipynb`), the data file (`Walmart_Store_sales.csv`), and other related files.

**Scope of the Project** 

The project involves working with a dataset that contains information about weekly sales achieved by different Walmart stores, and other variables such as the unemployment rate or the fuel price, that might be useful for predicting the amount of sales.

### 2. Project 03 - 2: Conversion Rate

#### Supervised machine learning

This project involves participating in a machine learning competition where we aim to build a model that predicts if a given user will subscribe to a newsletter, by using just a few information about the user. The competition aims at building a model that allows to predict the conversions (i.e. when a user will subscribe to the newsletter).

**Project Structure**

- `conversion-rate`: This directory contains the main Jupyter notebook (`conversion-rate.ipynb`), the data files (`conversion_data_train.csv`, `conversion_data_test.csv`), the predictions of the best model (`conversion_data_test_predictions_NIZAR-best_model.csv`), and other related files.

**Scope of the Project** 

The project involves working with two datasets: a labelled training dataset, and an unlabeled test dataset. The model's predictions will be evaluated independently and stored on a leaderboard.

### 3. Project 03 - 3: The NorthFace Ecommerce

#### Unsupervised machine learning

The marketing department of The North Face aims to boost online sales on their website by deploying a recommender system and improving the structure of the products catalog thanks to topic extraction.

**Project Structure**

- `northface-ecommerce`: This directory contains the main Jupyter notebook (`northface_ecommerce.ipynb`), the data file (`sample-data.csv`), and other related files.

**Scope of the Project** 

The project involves working with a corpus of item descriptions from The North Face's product catalog, with the aim of deploying a recommender system and improving the catalog structure.
