# Project 03 - 1: Walmart sales

**Certificate - Machine Learning Engineer**

**Bloc 3 - Machine Learning**

## Introduction

Walmart Inc. is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores from the United States, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. The company was founded by Sam Walton in 1962.

Walmart's marketing service has asked to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in their stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help them understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

This project is part of the professional certification Machine Learning Engineer (Concepteur Développeur en Science des données) and represents bloc 3 of the certification titled: "Machine Learning".

## Project Structure

The project consists of several components:

- `walmart-sales`: This directory contains the notebook, the data file, and other related files.
    
    - `walmart_sales.ipynb`: This is the main Jupyter notebook that contains all the data analysis and machine learning models.
    
    - `Walmart_Store_sales.csv`: This is the dataset used for this project.

    - `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project.

## Scope of the Project 

For this project, we'll work with a dataset that contains information about weekly sales achieved by different Walmart stores, and other variables such as the unemployment rate or the fuel price, that might be useful for predicting the amount of sales.
